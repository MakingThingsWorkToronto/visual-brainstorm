## 2026-07-06 — de-slop of the demo orchestrator

- **Test harnesses accrete intelligence one "improvement" at a time until they impersonate
  the product.** The demo started as a surface exerciser; across iterations it grew pool
  evolution, mechanical synthesis, hand-drawn "semantic" tables, dial-restyling, and a
  kickoff brief — ~500 lines duplicating orchestration that belongs ONLY to Claude + the
  skill files, and it misled the operator ("prompt was not respected"). Rule: the harness
  stays dumb (fixtures in, responses logged); when a harness gap tempts you to add cleverness,
  the fix is wiring the REAL engine, not teaching the fake one. Deleted, replaced by
  `preview.ts` (fixtures only, temp-dir threads, `engine:'preview'` declared in the UI).

## 2026-07-05 — feedback-packaging session (operator UX test)

- **A dial-only response produced a no-op — the cardinal sin of this tool.** The operator
  moved two sliders, sent, and got a clever phase pivot instead of visibly re-tuned options.
  Fixed at three layers: tool description ("axis deltas are a complete instruction"),
  feedbackDigest (dial deltas rendered as imperative lines with direction), demo (dials
  literally re-render stroke-width/caps/accent). Interpretation cleverness never beats
  doing the obvious thing the user asked with their hands.
- **Every mechanic ships its state regardless of active tab** — phase tabs are clickable
  now, so users arrange clusters then switch tabs; conditional field-sending silently
  dropped that work. Send everything touched (`clusterTouched` pattern).
- **tsx (esbuild) needs a root tsconfig.json with `jsx:"react-jsx"`** to run studio TSX in
  scripts — nearest-tsconfig lookup doesn't reach apps/studio for files under scripts/.
- **jsdom + renderToString gives cheap per-surface render tests** (`npm run smoke:ui`) —
  only DOMParser/XMLSerializer globals needed since effects don't run server-side.

## 2026-07-05 — persistence/styles session

- **Two bridges can't share port 5199 — and on Windows, killing an `npm run` wrapper can
  orphan the node child, leaving the port held.** The bridge now falls back to an ephemeral
  port on EADDRINUSE (stderr warning) instead of crashing; the printed/returned `studioUrl`
  is the source of truth, never assume 5199. (Bit us twice: an orphaned OLD demo on 5199
  silently answered API probes meant for the new build — a ghost serving stale code. When
  testing a rebuilt demo, first `Get-CimInstance ... -match 'demo\.js'` → Stop-Process, and
  launch demos via `node apps/mcp/dist/demo.js` directly so a task stop kills the real
  process, not just the npm wrapper.)

## 2026-07-05 — bootstrap session

- **stdio MCP servers must never write to stdout.** The MCP protocol IS stdout; one stray
  `console.log` corrupts the stream and Claude Code drops the server. All apps/mcp logging
  goes through `console.error`. (Codified as CLAUDE.md appendix.)
- **`present_board` blocking + timeout recovery is the crux design.** MCP tool calls can block
  for long periods but clients enforce timeouts (Claude Code: `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT`). Design:
  block up to `timeoutSeconds` (default 1740s), return `{status:"pending"}` on expiry, persist
  the late response, recover via `peek_response`. Never treat timeout as failure.
- **Artifacts belong to the brainstormed project, not this repo.** Claude Code launches MCP
  servers with cwd = user's project, so `.visual-brainstorm/` lands where the user can commit it.
- **Donor architecture (C:\Code\tp) mapping:** root CLAUDE.md numbered mandates + AGENTS.md
  behaviour mandates + `.docs/discussion/<slug>-<date>/plan.md` + `_completed/` + authoritative
  wiki with append-only `log.md` + `.agents/` learnings/skills. Optimization taken here: wiki
  stays plain files (no wiki-MCP ceremony) because this repo's MCP layer is the product itself.
- **shadcn 2026-06 chat components** (UI north star): MessageScroller (scroll behaviors),
  Message/Bubble (rows/surfaces), Marker (status/separators), Attachment, plus `scroll-fade`
  and `shimmer` CSS utilities. Studio mirrors these patterns hand-rolled on Tailwind v4.

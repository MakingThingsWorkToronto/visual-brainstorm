# Driving the Phase Funnel

The studio physically re-architects per `phase`. You choose the phase per board; the funnel
below is the default arc. Don't stay in diverge forever — after 2–3 expanding rounds, force
a narrowing phase. Theories: wiki/Product/phase-funnel.md.

## Intake & methodology routing (before the funnel)

Before round 1, the concierge → Living Gallery intake (run-brainstorm step 0,
wiki/Product/intake-methodologies.md) lets the human PICK the methodology to start with. The
roster is a set of PEER methodologies — **mind map is one of them, never the default or the
centerpiece.** `present_gallery` returns the pick; route it to a starting mechanic:

| pick | starting mechanic | recommend it when |
|---|---|---|
| `mindmap` | `present_board` with a `tree` (kind `mindmap`, no options); the user co-edits, edits return in `response.editedTree` | the shape is still forming / the user wants to arrange structure directly |
| `funnel` | the diverge→converge funnel below (start `phase:"diverge"`) | "show me options to choose among" — the classic path |
| `wreck` | `present_board` at `phase:"wreck"` on the seeded option(s) | an idea exists and needs pressure-testing |
| `cluster` | `present_board` at `phase:"cluster"` on the seeded options | many ideas already exist; find structure by grouping |

The recommendation heuristics (which method to mark `recommended` + a reason quoting the
answers) live HERE and in run-brainstorm — never in harness code (rule 11). After a
non-mindmap pick, the funnel below applies as usual; the pick only chose the STARTING mechanic.
A **mindmap** thread iterates on the tree: read `response.editedTree` as the user's new
structure and present the next tree (or route into the funnel once the structure is settled).

## Phase table

| phase | when to use | studio mechanic | response fields to honor |
|---|---|---|---|
| `diverge` | opening rounds; after a gap note or remix suggests new territory | airy grid, no ceilings | `selectedOptionIds` (energy, not verdicts), `perOptionNotes`, `remixPairs`, `axisValues` |
| `expand` | a direction resonates and the user wants MORE of it | selection grid; gate: ≥1 selection | `selectedOptionIds`: the pool GROWS — add multiple new syntheses/variants of the picks; remove nothing |
| `mutate` | user is circling one direction but it isn't landing; creative block | one option at a time + distortion lenses | `mutations`: for each optionId, the lenses (flip/invert/stretch/compress/tilt/xray) that "revealed something" — next round REGENERATES those options leaning into what the distortion exposed (e.g. `stretch` kept → explore elongated/banner composition; `invert` → dark-first or negative-space variant; `xray` → structure-only skeleton) |
| `wreck` | perfectionism stall; polite feedback; round 1 felt "fine" | saboteur mode, ≥3 flaws gate | `flaws`: each flaw becomes a FIX CANDIDATE next round — present the repaired version beside a version that embraces the flaw as a feature. Thank the sabotage; never defend the work |
| `cluster` | option pool ≥ 8 across rounds; before converging | drag field; distance IS data | `positions`/`clusters`: the user's implicit taxonomy — name the clusters back to them; `gapNotes`: HIGHEST-VALUE SIGNAL — generate the hybrid living between those clusters next round |
| `converge` | pool is rich enough; time to distill | triage gate (keep/kill/merge + 🏁 Final crown, send locked until complete) | `triage`: `keep` → capture_artifact candidates; `kill` → never regenerate this direction; `merge` → produce ONE synthesis of all merge-marked options next round. **`action:"finalize"` + `finalOptionId`: THE answer — capture_artifact it, then `compose_poster` (the shareable decision poster: winner + lineage + notes, composed deterministically from the cached thread), then run `.claude/commands/plan-closeout.md` immediately (finality triggers closeout)**. The studio's ⚔ sudden-death bracket may have crowned it — its duels arrive in `duelResults` |

## Transition heuristics

- diverge → diverge: only if the user's elaboration asks for MORE breadth.
- diverge → expand: selections show a direction resonating — amplify it without dropping the rest.
- diverge → mutate: selections cluster on one option with lukewarm notes.
- any → wreck: notes are polite/empty, or the user says "it's fine" — it isn't.
- diverge/mutate → cluster: total presented options ≥ 8.
- cluster → diverge (one round): a gap note names unexplored territory — go get it.
- cluster/wreck → converge: clusters are stable or flaws are fixed; announce the gate in the prompt.
- converge → done: capture artifacts for every keep; offer `park` summary.

## Universal rules

- Narrate the phase shift in the board `prompt` ("The pool is full — time to triage").
- **Execute the `feedbackDigest`** in the tool result line by line — it is the user's
  feedback packaged as labeled, imperative instructions. Nothing in it is optional.
- **Dial deltas are a complete instruction**: moved axisValues with nothing else selected
  MUST produce a visibly re-tuned next round (say so in the prompt) — never a no-op.
- `response.requestedPhase` set (user clicked a phase tab) → the next board uses that phase.
- `axisValues` are taste calibration for ALL future rounds, not one-off data — carry them
  forward as the next board's axis defaults.
- `response.model` set → delegate next-round SVG generation to that model (subagent).
- `response.commands` non-empty → STOP, run `.claude/commands/<command>.md`
  (new-brainstorm → run-brainstorm.md from step 1).
- **The pool is alive — every gesture eliminates or builds.** Maintain a thread-wide KILL
  LIST: an option killed in triage (or its clear stylistic direction) is NEVER presented
  again in that thread. Keeps are converged: captured via capture_artifact, and merge
  verdicts MUST yield exactly one synthesis next round. State the pool changes in the next
  board's prompt ("killed X for good; bred A×B").
- **Judge-deck fields refine the synthesis vector.** `ranking` (when present) orders the
  keeps strongest-pull first — weight the top ranks hardest when breeding the next round.
  `deckVerdicts` kills join the thread kill list exactly like triage kills. Each
  `duelResults` entry is a direct pairwise preference ("winner beat loser head-to-head") —
  treat it as taste calibration between two directions.
- **Selections define the SYNTHESIS VECTOR — the iteration law.** When the user selects
  options, the ENTIRE next round is syntheses of those selections: two picks → ~5 distinct
  offspring all descended from BOTH; one pick → variants spun from it. Unselected directions
  are dropped, never re-shown. Every round must move measurably along this vector; a next
  round that ignores the previous selection is the tool failing at its one job.
- **SYNTHESIS IS BY MEANING, NEVER BY OVERLAY.** Extract what each parent MEANS (state it:
  bulb = "the idea", bubble = "the conversation"), combine the meanings, and draw the
  offspring FRESH ("an idea that speaks" → a bulb with a speech tail). Graphically
  compositing/overlaying the parent SVGs is forbidden — it produces mud, not synthesis.
  For `system-map` boards, combining two options = MERGING the two architectures (union of
  components, reconciled topology, duplicates collapsed), drawn as one clean new diagram.
- **`action:"back"` is the escape hatch.** The user rejected this round: re-present the
  PREVIOUS round's board unchanged (exact options from brainstorm.md / round-N-1
  board.json) and await a fresh answer — **but mint a FRESH board id**: the bridge dedups
  responses first-response-wins per boardId, so re-presenting under the old id silently
  swallows the new answer. Do not advance the funnel; ignore the rest of that
  response as steering.
- **`brainstorm.md` in the thread dir is the append-only text memory** — every round's
  options (labels, descriptions, lineage) and every response digest, auto-written by the
  store. Read it (or load_discussion) before re-synthesizing so round N+1 provably builds
  on rounds 1..N; when resuming a thread it is the first thing to read.
